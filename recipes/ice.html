        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is one of my favorite recipes. I find it pairs well with a number of drinks such as water, soda, and juice, and is an essential ingredient in iced tea.</p>
        <p>Making this recipe always brings back memories of my childhood, where my mother would often prepare ice for its health benefits -- just apply it to a swollen area!</p>
        <p><strong>Warning:</strong> this dish should not be consumed directly, as it could lead to tooth breakage. Rather, serve it after it has been processed in a blender, or combine with liquid and drink the liquid around it.</p>
